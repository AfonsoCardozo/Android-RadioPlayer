This is a demo Android app that makes use of the Feed Media SDK
to power a Pandora-style Internet-radio app. The app has a sample
custom notification layout and shows how you can use station
metadata to hide stations and assign images and
descriptive text to them.

Check out our [iOS version](https://github.com/feedfm/iOS-RadioPlayer) as well!
